## Welcome to Resource

First and foremost, **always use a VPN**.  If worst comes to worst, we don't want anyone to be able to track you down.  Also, **always use a passphrase** that includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and smybols, not just a password. We don't want anyone's account breached, and passwords are too short.

### What is Resource?

This project is about gathering information related to politics, including:
- The President
- Presidential Candidates
- Congress Members
- Policies
- Media Bias
- And any data we can get our hands on.

All information needs to be sourced, and we will be creating a credibility score system for high confidence information and above.  Any information that doesn't reach the bare minimum of high confidence will not be approve to be on here.

### Credibility Score

In order of most to least credible we will accept:

Original Source - Video, photos, audio, bills, amendments, signed legal documents, and other like material.

Peer Reviewed - Data and information that reaches peer review standards, from scientists, historians, and other such sources.

News Sources - Only news sources that rank as [neutral and original fact reporting](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/), only those listed below for right now:
- AP
- Reuters
- Bloomberg
- C-Span
- NPR

Government Source - Information that has come from the US, or a US allied, government.

We are currently not accepting first hand accounts from sources within the government, as we are not currently set up to verify individuals and corroborate to an acceptable standard.  We will accept documents posted from such sources though, and use people we do trust to verify the documents.
